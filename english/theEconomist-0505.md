The Financial Times reported that the Biden administration is skeptical of First Republic’s efforts to find a private-sector solution that would shore up confidence in the bank.

shore up是个非常形象的表达，最初的意思是指用大块木头、金属等来支撑墙或屋顶，后来使用范围扩大，泛指“加强、巩固”。
常见的搭配有：shore up support巩固支持、shore up the economy稳固经济。
可用reinforce、strengthen、bolster, enhance, boost等替换，反义词有undermine, weaken等。



The West may find it hard to shore up their defences.

To succeed like Elon Musk, you need to have what it takes – determination, creativity, and a willingness to take risks.

Consequently, both the male and the female's statements hold merit, and it is essential to strike a balance between our academic pursuits and exploratory learning.

The male voices his conviction that attendance at the lecture would indisputably prove advantageous, while the female counters that there is little utility in listening to a lecture outside of their particular field of expertise. The implicit message conveyed by this image underscores the paramount importance of possessing an open-minded disposition and embracing innovative concepts and information, regardless of whether they are related to one's designated area of study.
>
>It is my unwavering belief that one must possess a malleable disposition and constantly strive for knowledge that transcends the boundaries of our respective disciplines. Engaging with diverse subject matters can stimulate one's understanding, broaden perspectives, and foster critical thinking about the ever-evolving world around us.
